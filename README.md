## Running The Notebooks
You can view the tutorials online or download and run locally.

### Running Online

|Service      | Usage |
|-------------|---------|
|Jupyter Nbviewer| Render and view the notebooks (can not edit) |
|Google Colab| Render, view, edit and save the notebooks to Google Drive (limited time) |


Jupyter Nbviewer:

[![nbviewer](https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/SDMRL/blob/main/tutorials/assets/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/SDMRL/tree/main/tutorials/)


Press on the "Open in Colab" button below to use Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/SDMRL)


### Running Locally

Press "Download ZIP" under the green button `Clone or download` or use `git` to clone the repository using the 
following command: `git clone https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/SDMRL.git` (in cmd/PowerShell in Windows or in the Terminal in Linux/Mac)

Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook (it is recommended to use Anaconda). Installation instructions can be found in `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`.


## Installation Instructions

For the complete guide, with step-by-step images, please consult `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`

1. Get Anaconda with Python 3, follow the instructions according to your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) at: https://www.anaconda.com/download
2. Install the basic packages using the provided `environment.yml` file by running: `conda env create -f environment.yml` which will create a new conda environment named `SDMRL`. If you did this, you will only need to install PyTorch, see the table below.
3. Alternatively, you can create a new environment for the course and install packages from scratch:
In Windows open `Anaconda Prompt` from the start menu, in Mac/Linux open the terminal and run `conda create --name SDMRL`. Full guide at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands
4. To activate the environment, open the terminal (or `Anaconda Prompt` in Windows) and run `conda activate SDMRL`
5. Install the required libraries according to the table below (to search for a specific library and the corresponding command you can also look at https://anaconda.org/)

### Libraries to Install

|Library         | Command to Run |
|------------------|---------|
|`Jupyter Notebook`|  `conda install -c conda-forge notebook`|
|`numpy`|  `conda install -c conda-forge numpy`|
|`matplotlib`|  `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`|
|`tqdm`| `conda install -c conda-forge tqdm`|
|`gymnasium`| `pip install gymnasium`|
|`pettingzoo`| `pip install pettingzoo`|
|`stable-baselines3`| `pip install stable-baselines3`|
|`pytorch` (cpu)| `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch` (<a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">get command from PyTorch.org</a>)|
|`pytorch` (gpu)| `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia` (<a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">get command from PyTorch.org</a>)|



5. To open the notebooks, open Ananconda Navigator or run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal (or `Anaconda Prompt` in Windows) while the `SDMRL` environment is activated.
