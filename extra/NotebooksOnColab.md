## How to Open Tutorial ipynb Notebooks on Google Colab

You can open and run the Jupyter notebooks in this repository using Google Colab by following these steps:

### Option 1: Using the Colab Interface

1. **Using the Colab Interface to Open from GitHub**
   - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) in your browser.
   - Click on `File` in the top menu, then `Open notebook`.
   - Select the `GitHub` tab in the pop-up window.
   - Authenticate with GitHub if required.
   - Paste the following GitHub URL into the search bar and press Enter:
     ```
     https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/CLAI
     ```
   - Navigate to the specific notebook you want to open and select it from the search results.


### Option 2: Direct URL Modification

1. **Find the Notebook on GitHub**
   - Navigate to the `.ipynb` file you want to open in Google Colab.

2. **Copy the GitHub URL**
   - Copy the URL from your browser's address bar when viewing the notebook. It should look like this: `https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/CLAI/blob/main/tutorials/tut01/Gymnasium.ipynb`.

3. **Modify the URL for Google Colab**
   - Modify the URL to fit the Google Colab format by replacing `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com`.
   - For example, change:
     ```
     https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/CLAI/blob/main/tutorials/tut01/Gymnasium.ipynb
     ```
     to:
     ```
     https://githubtocolab.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/CLAI/blob/main/tutorials/tut01/Gymnasium.ipynb
     ```

4. **Open the Modified URL**
   - Paste the modified URL into your browser's address bar and press Enter.
   - This will redirect you to Google Colab with the notebook opened and ready to use.


By following these steps, you can easily open and work on Jupyter notebooks from this repository in Google Colab.
